/*
    06/08/15 - version 2.0
        -   Fixed an issue with getProcessBaseAddress() on 32 bit OS systems.
            The returned value was incorrect - however it would still work, as the lower 4 bytes were correct. 
    07/05/15 - version 1.9
        - Fixed an issue with processPatternScan() failing when the startAddress was not 0. 
    17/12/14 - version 1.8
        - Fixed a 'bitness' bug in _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION 
    12/12/14 - version 1.7
        - Added an 'endAddress' parameter to processPatternScan.
    10/11/14 - version 1.6
        - Wild card bytes in the pattern scan functions can now be denoted by any non-numeric value e.g. "?", "wild" or "" (null)
    17/10/14 - version 1.5
        - Fixed a bug in writeString() which would cause the null terminator to be erroneously removed. 
    23/09/14 - version 1.4
        - The various read and write methods should now support pointers in 64 bit target applications providing AHK is also 64 bit.
            -> When the new operator is used the target application's bitness is checked. If it 64 bit, pointers will then be read as Int64s.
            -> A 32 bit AHK can read/write and use pointers in a 64 bit target application providing the addresses can fit inside a 4 byte ptr.
               If the address is too large, only the lower 4 bytes are passed to ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() i.e. the wrong address is passed.
        - readString() has been slightly optimised when reading null terminated strings of unknown size.
        - New methods:  
            - suspend(), resume(), and isTargetProcess64Bit()
        - OpenProcess() has been modified and closeProcess() has been replaced by CloseHandle()
            -> These two changes will not affect users unless your code calls them directly.
        - Fixed a bug in _MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION
        - Added 'aRights' object which contains various handle access constants.
    19/09/14 - version 1.3
        -   Renamed some methods.
        -   Old name --> New name
        -   getBaseAddressOfModule() --> getModuleBaseAddress()
        -   ReadRawMemory() --> readRaw()
        -   writeBuffer() --> writeRaw()
    17/08/14
        -   Change class name to _ClassMemory
    1/08/14 - version 1.2
        -   getProcessBaseAddress() dllcall now returns Int64. This prevents a negative number (overflow)
            when reading the base address of a 64 bit target process from a 32 bit AHK process.
        -   Added various pattern scan methods.
    30/07/14 - version 1.1
        -   EnumProcessModulesEx() is now used instead of EnumProcessModules().
            This allows for getModuleBaseAddress() in a 64 bit AHK process to enumerate
            (and find) the modules in a 32 bit target process.
    12/07/14 - version 1.0
        -   Added writeRaw() method
        -   Added a version number to the class
    10/06/14
        -   Fixed a bug introduced by the above change, which prevented the function returning 
            the base address of the process.
    18/05/14
        -   Fixed issue with get getModuleBaseAddress() returning the incorrect module 
            when specified module name formed part of another modules name

    RHCP's basic memory class:

    This is a basic wrapper for commonly used read and write memory functions.
    It also contains a variety of pattern scan functions. 
    This class allows scripts to read/write integers and strings of various types. 
    Pointer addresses can easily be read/written by passing the base address and offsets to the various read/write functions.
    
    Process handles are kept open between reads. This increases speed.
    However, if a program closes/restarts then the process handle will become invalid
    and you will need to re-open another handle (blank/destroy the object and recreate it)

    read(), readString(), write(), and writeString() can be used to read and write memory addresses respectively.

    readRaw() can be used to dump large chunks of memory, this is considerably faster when
    reading data from a large structure compared to repeated calls to read(). 
    For example, reading a single UInt takes approximately the same amount of time as reading 1000 bytes via readRaw().
    Although, most people wouldn't notice the performance difference. This does however require you 
    to retrieve the values using AHK's numget()/strGet() from the dumped memory.

    In a similar fashion writeRaw() allows a buffer to be be written in a single operation. 
    
    When the new operator is used this class returns an object which can be used to read that process's 
    memory space.To read another process simply create another object.

    Process handles are automatically closed when the script exits/restarts or when you free the object.

    **Notes:
        This was initially written for 32 bit target processes, however the various read/write functions
        should now completely support pointers in 64 bit target applications. The only caveat is that the AHK exe must also be 64 bit.  
        If AHK is 32 bit and the target application is 64 bit you can still read, write, and use pointers, so long as the addresses
        can fit inside a 4 byte pointer. The pointer pBaseAddress parameter in ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() is the limiting factor here.
        If AHK is 32 bit pBaseAddress will be a 4 byte pointer. This limits the maximum address which can be passed to the 32 bit range.

        The various pattern scan functions are intended to be used on 32 bit target applications, however: 
            - A 32 bit AHK script can perform pattern scans on a 32 bit target application.
            - A 32 bit AHK script may be able to perform pattern scans on a 64 bit process, providing the addresses fall within the 32 bit range.             
            - A 64 bit AHK script should be able to perform pattern scans on a 32 bit target application without issue. 
            - A 64 bit AHK script should be able to perform pattern scans on a 64 bit target application, however issues may arise at very high memory addresses as AHK does not support UInt64.

        If the target process has admin privileges, then the AHK script will also require admin privileges. 

        AHK doesn't support unsigned 64bit ints, you can however read them as Int64 and interpret negative values as large numbers.       
  

    Commonly used methods:
        read()
        readString()
        readRaw()
        write()
        writeString()
        writeRaw()
        getProcessBaseAddress()
        getModuleBaseAddress()

    Less commonly used methods:    
        modulePatternScan()
        addressPatternScan()
        processPatternScan()
        rawPatternScan()
        getModules()
        suspend()
        resume()

    Internal methods: (some may be useful when directly called)
        getAddressFromOffsets() ; This will return the final memory address of a pointer. This is useful if the pointed address only changes on startup or map/level change and you want to eliminate the overhead associated with pointers.
        isTargetProcess64Bit()
        pointer() 
        GetModuleFileNameEx()
        EnumProcessModulesEx()
        GetModuleInformation()
        getNeedleFromAOBPattern()
        virtualQueryEx()
        patternScan()
        bufferScanForMaskedPattern()
        openProcess()
        closeHandle()   

    Usage:

        **Note: If you wish to try this calc example, consider using the 32 bit version of calc.exe - 
                which is in C:\Windows\SysWOW64\calc.exe on 64 bit systems. If calc.exe is 64 bit and the AHK exe is 32 bit
                the getModuleBaseAddress() example will not work.

        The contents of this file can be copied directly into your script. Alternately you can copy the classMemory.ahk file into your library folder,
        in which case you will need to use the #include directive in your script i.e. #Include <classMemory>
        You can use this code to check if you have installed the class correctly.
        if (_ClassMemory.__Class != "_ClassMemory")
            msgbox class memory not correctly installed. Or the (global class) variable "_ClassMemory" has been overwritten

        Open a process with sufficient access to read and write memory addresses (this is required before you can use the other functions)
        You only need to do this once. But if the process closes/restarts, then you will need to perform this step again. Refer to the notes section below.
        Also, if the target process is running as admin, then the script will also require admin rights!
        Note: The program identifier can be any AHK windowTitle i.e.ahk_exe, ahk_class, ahk_pid, or simply the window title.
        hProcessCopy is an optional variable in which the opened handled is stored. 
          
            calc := new _ClassMemory("ahk_exe calc.exe", "", hProcessCopy) 
       
        A couple of ways to check if the above method was successful.
            if !isObject(calc)
                msgbox failed to open a handle
            if !hProcessCopy
                msgbox failed to open a handle. Error Code = %hProcessCopy%

        Get the process's base address.
            msgbox % calc.BaseAddress ; When using the new operator this property is automatically set to the result of getProcessBaseAddress()
        Or If that is not the correct base address, try using getModuleBaseAddress().
            msgbox % calc.getModuleBaseAddress()

        Get the base address of a specific module.
            msgbox % calc.getModuleBaseAddress("GDI32.dll")

        The rest of these examples are just for illustration (the addresses specified are probably not valid).
        You can use cheat engine to find real addresses to read and write to for testing purposes.
        
        Write 1234 as a UInt at address 0x0016CB60.
            calc.write(0x0016CB60, 1234, "UInt")

        Read a UInt.
            value := calc.read(0x0016CB60, "UInt")

        Read a pointer with offsets 0x20 and 0x15C which points to a UChar. 
            value := calc.read(pointerBase, "UChar", 0x20, 0x15C)

        Note: read(), readString(), readRaw(), write(), writeString(), and writeRaw() all support pointers/offsets.
        An array of pointers can be passed directly, i.e.
            arrayPointerOffsets := [0x20, 0x15C]
            value := calc.read(pointerBase, "UChar", arrayPointerOffsets*)
        Or they can be entered manually.
            value := calc.read(pointerBase, "UChar", 0x20, 0x15C)

        
        Read a utf-16 null terminated string of unknown size at address 0x1234556 - the function will read until the null terminator is found or something goes wrong.
            string := calc.readString(0x1234556, length := 0, encoding := "utf-16")
        
        Read a utf-8 encoded string which is 12 bytes long at address 0x1234556.
            string := calc.readString(0x1234556, 12)

        By default a null terminator is included at the end of written strings for writeString().
        The nullterminator property can be used to change this.
            _ClassMemory.insertNullTerminator := False ; This will change the property for all processes
            calc.insertNullTerminator := False ; Changes the property for just this process     


    Notes: 
        If the target process exits and then starts again (or restarts) you will need to free the derived object and then use the new operator to create a new object i.e. 
        calc := [] ; or calc := "" ; free the object. This is actually optional if using the line below, as the line below would free the previous derived object calc prior to initialising the new copy.
        calc := new _ClassMemory("ahk_exe calc.exe") ; Create a new derived object to read calc's memory.

    ; Method:   readRaw(address, byRef buffer, bytes := 4, aOffsets*)
    ;           Reads an area of the processes memory and stores it in the buffer variable
    ; Parameters:
    ;       address  -  The memory address of the area to read or if using the offsets parameter
    ;                   the base address of the pointer which points to the memory region.
    ;       buffer   -  The unquoted variable name for the buffer. This variable will receive the contents from the address space.
    ;                   This method calls varsetCapcity() to ensure the variable has an adequate size to perform the operation. 
    ;                   If the variable already has a larger capacity (from a previous call to varsetcapcity()), then it will not be shrunk. 
    ;                   Therefore it is the callers responsibility to ensure that any subsequent actions performed on the buffer variable
    ;                   do not exceed the bytes which have been read - as these remaining bytes could contain anything.
    ;       bytes   -   The number of bytes to be read.          
    ;       aOffsets* - A variadic list of offsets. When using offsets the address parameter should equal the base address of the pointer.
    ;                   The address (bass address) and offsets should point to the memory address which is to be read
    ; Return Values:
    ;       Non Zero -   Indicates success.
    ;       Zero     -   Indicates failure. Check errorLevel and A_LastError for more information
    ; 
    ; Notes:            The contents of the buffer may then be retrieved using AHK's NumGet() and StrGet() functions.           
    ;                   This method offers significant (~30% and up) performance boost when reading large areas of memory. 
    ;                   As calling ReadProcessMemory for four bytes takes a similar amount of time as it does for 1,000 bytes.

    ;                   the base address of the pointer.
    ;       sizeBytes - The size (in bytes) of the string to be read.
    ;                   If zero is passed, then the function will read each character until a null terminator is found
    ;                   and then returns the entire string.
    ;       encoding -  This refers to how the string is stored in the program's memory.
    ;                   UTF-8 and UTF-16 are common. Refer to the AHK manual for other encoding types.
    ;       aOffsets* - A variadic list of offsets. When using offsets the address parameter should equal the base address of the pointer.
    ;                   The address (bass address) and offsets should point to the memory address which holds the string.                             
    ;                   
    ;  Return Values:
    ;       String -    On failure an empty (null) string is always returned. Since it's possible for the actual string 
    ;                   being read to be null (empty), then a null return value should not be used to determine failure of the method.
    ;                   Instead the property [derivedObject].ReadStringLastError can be used to check for success/failure.
    ;                   This property is set to 0 on success and 1 on failure. On failure ErrorLevel and A_LastError should be consulted
    ;                   for more information.
    ; Notes:
    ;       For best performance use the sizeBytes parameter to specify the exact size of the string. 
    ;       If the exact size is not known and the string is null terminated, then specifying the maximum
    ;       possible size of the string will yield the same performance.  
    ;       If neither the actual or maximum size is known and the string is null terminated, then specifying
    ;       zero for the sizeBytes parameter is fine. Generally speaking for all intents and purposes the performance difference is
    ;       inconsequential.

    ;   These are undocumented Windows functions which suspend and resume the process. Here be dragons.
    ;   The process handle must have PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME access rights. 
    ;   That is, you must specify this when using the new operator, as it is not included. 
    ;   Some people say it requires more rights and just use PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, however PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME has worked for me.
    ;   Suspending a process manually can be quite helpful when reversing memory addresses and pointers, although it's not at all required. 
    ;   As an unorthodox example, memory addresses holding pointers are often stored in a slightly obfuscated manner i.e. they require bit operations to calculate their
    ;   true stored value (address). This obfuscation can prevent Cheat Engine from finding the true origin of a pointer or links to other memory regions. If there 
    ;   are no static addresses between the obfuscated address and the final destination address then CE wont find anything (there are ways around this in CE). One way around this is to
    ;   suspend the process, write the true/deobfuscated value to the address and then perform your scans. Afterwards write back the original values and resume the process.

    ;   sizeOfRegionBytes - The numbers of bytes to scan in the memory region.
    ;   patternMask -       This string indicates which bytes must match and which bytes are wild. Each wildcard byte must be denoted by a single '?'.
